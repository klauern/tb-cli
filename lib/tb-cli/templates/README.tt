Here's a new application
========================

Nothing fancy, so if you're looking for more details on how to 
actually generate a nice Torquebox project, there is a wealth
of good information to be found on the Torquebox documentation:

  http://torquebox.org/documentation/1.0.0

What's in this project?
-----------------------

There are currently a handful of base files to make your first
Torquebox app:

  - app.rb          Your Application
  - config.ru       Your Rackup file (see http://m.onkey.org/ruby-on-rack-1-hello-rack)
  - Rakefile        See http://torquebox.org/documentation/1.0.0/deployment.html#deploy-using-rake
  - torquebox.yml   Your Torquebox YAML file for configuring all the fancy Torquebox-y things
  - README          This file
